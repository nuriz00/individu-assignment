<p>I start my education in 2006 when I was 6 years old. 
I attend school near my house at Sekolah Kebangsaan Melor. 
I went to that school until class 3 and the school was moved to new building.
 It’s far away from my house, but it’s not too far. 
Then I transfer to new school which is Sekolah Kebangsaan Sri Melor. 
I went to that school there until class 6 which is end of primary school. 
I sat in UPSR exam, but at that time I not really think of studying so I only get 1A 2B 2C.
Later on I start to thinking that I should get more than this.<p>

<p>In 2013, I was 13 years old. 
I entered secondary school at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Melor. 
This school located near my secondary school. 
They located beside each other. 
This time I determine to become better than before. 
I tried my best and every year I went to a better class. 
In 2015, I sat on PT3 exam, and I got 7A 1B 2C.  
So, I manage to entered account class. 
I’m really proud of myself and I didn’t really expect it. 
In 2017, I need to sit for a very important exam which is SPM. 
My SPM result is 5A 2B 1C 1D.<p>

<p>After that, in 2018 I start my education at diploma level. 
I manage to entered Universiti Teknologi Mara in Kampus Machang. 
I’m really honoured to enter one of most prestigious university. 
And until now I still study there in my last semester as diploma student in faculty of Information Management.<p>
