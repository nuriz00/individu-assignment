<ul><p>I come from ordinary family. 
Living with simple  and happy life. 
I live with my mother and my siblings. My mother is housewife. 
My father already passed away when I was children. 
At that time, I was 2 years old. Still children that doesn’t know anything.<p>

<p>My family has been always by my side in ups and downs. 
They have though me how to be a better person. 
My mother is my strength as I can always count on her when I need a shoulder to cry on. 
She believes in me more than others do. She is the backbone of our family now. 
My siblings are my best friend on whom I can always fall back on. 
My family is my power that keeps pushing me to achieve a better life. 
I will forever be indebted to my family for all they have done to me. 
I cannot imagine my life without them.<p>

<p>“My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what’s important to me.”<p>
